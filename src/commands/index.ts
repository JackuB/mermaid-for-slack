         * Note about DMs:
         * I've tried making Mermaid Preview respond to DMs, but I don't think it's currently possible with Slack API.
         *
         * What I've tried:
         *
         * ## Upload a file directly to the DM
         * This is not allowed with Slack API.
         *
         * ## Respond as a bot to the user
         * Use the `client.conversations.open`, to get a DM between the user and the bot.
         * I can upload a file there, but the message opens in a "App Home > Messages". Outside of the (self) DM, so I needed to redirect user there ðŸ™„.
         * But this is breaking Slack guidelines, so I couldn't get the app approved for the App Directory ðŸ™„.
         * This worked fairly well, but it's not a good user experience.
         *
         * ## Upload a file, then share it back to the user
         * I tried to upload a file to Slack, and use its private URL or ID to share it back to the user.
         * I could get the URL, but it was a private URL, so the user couldn't access it.
         * My bot can't call `client.files.sharedPublicURL` to make the image public, because it's limited for User tokens.
         * I can respond to the user directly with `response_url`, but no way to share the file back to the user.
         *
         * Only way I can imagine this working with how Slack defines its API is to host rendered images on a [my] server, and share a link to it.
         * I want to avoid it at all costs.
         *
         * For this reason, I need to stop the bot from responding to DMs.
